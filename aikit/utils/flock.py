# NOTE:
# `flock()` did not work over NFS in Linux kernels up to 2.6.11 but works in later Linux kernels.
# This is discussed around the internet and is documented here: https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/flock.2.html.
# https://linux.die.net/man/2/flock is outdated and says "...flock() does not lock files over NFS. Use fcntl(2) instead...".
